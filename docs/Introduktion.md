## SampleSite vs GeoGIS points/intakes
In relation to GeoGIS a SampleSite (sampleSiteId) is either a point (points-table) or intake (intakes-table). 
The SampleSite GET represents data from both GeoGIS point-table and GeoGIS intake-table as both can be regarded as a samplesite (in relation to the StanLab api specification https://stanlab-api.miljoeportal.dk/openapi/)
The response is structured so it is easy to see if data is an intake or point in GeoGIS.
